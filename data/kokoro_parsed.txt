well first off is the game selection which is pretty much a no brainer. yes xbox has backwards compatibility, but if you're paying 500$ for that, there is a problem. you can play them on a regular xb1 just fine, or just use your 360 for games that will never even have bc. that is what i do. or even a basic pc will play 360 games. ps4 hands down has some of the best exclusives ever made, from spiderman, god of war, uncharted (series) to simple games like persona, until dawn, detroit become human etc. all great stuff. xb1 basically has gears, halo and forza, most of which can be played on pc, soon to be streamed. or just ported to pc anyway. something sony does not do, which is why i like their integrity.     secondly this basically has 2 ps4 gpu/apu is in it, running at 4.2 teraflops, which is nothing to scoff at, considering it is on par with a gtx 980 which still runs most moderns games way above 60fps (in pc form). so it is not a slouch by any means. and the x may have 6 teraflops of gpu power, but to me it means nothing if you do not have the software to back it up. and some games on the ps4 pro run at 4k, and you ca not tell the difference on a 4k tv whether it is upscaled or not, games still look amazing.     third, the price of 399$ is fantastic for what you get, no sony did not "need" the pro but they thought hey we have the greatest console on the planet, why not charge 100$ more and make it even greater. microsoft on the other hand "desperately" needed the x because of the original is lack of power, and low resolutions/framerates. so more power to them (pun intended). also the regular ps4 if most can recall was 399$ until around the beginning of 2017, or even 2016 when the pro came out. so it was never cheap. i can even say for the x being 499$ is not horrid, because upon launch the original was the "same" price.     lastly, it is just great, like the original but better (of course). great controls, games, the system overall is very silent and if you do hear it it is not like the old jet systems from years ago. and it is future proof enough until the ps5 is released, and they will still be making games long after it comes out. so no worries here. also psnow is not bad at all if u have a great internet connection. which in 2019 should not be an issue for anyone. lots of great ps3, ps2 titles to play. also the reliability for the s and the x is very underwhelming, lots of heating/fan issues overall for many folks. so for peanuts get this, it is a great 4k or close enough system, and sony have never going around boasting or touting its the most power system on the planet, as ms do. and does it really matter? they are made to play games, not to have a pi%%ing contest. but most gamers have turned it into that. also the framerates are very much improved or at least much steadier on this system. compared to the slim. even though it is still fantastic. so get this, and enjoy, you wo not regret it for the price. oh yeah and vr, where is it ms? :)
so here\s the deal, i am a gaming nerd. i have a pc, xbox one x, and now i have the ps4 pro. i won\t compare the consoles to the pc because a console can\t match the specs of higher end gaming pc\s. with that being said, here\s where i give the edge to each console:    graphics- xbox one x. the ps4 pro no doubt still looks amazing gaming at 4k, but for me personally, i notice the xbox one x has a better look to its games.     services- slight edge to ps4. xbox one requires $60 for yearly xbox love and you can also sign up for game pass where can get new games added monthly. ps4 also has a $60 yearly subscription fee if you want to game online and you can add playatation now for on demand gaming. however, ps4 does give you an option for live stream tv through playstation vue for $45 a month.     controller- xbox one. i\ve always enjoyed how an xbox controller fits in my hand compared to playstation. however, i realize this is highly subjective. xbox controllers do take aa batteries, while ps4 pro controllers are rechargeable.     content- huge advantage here to ps4. i\ll be completely honest, i\m the biggest xbox one fan boy there is. i\ve been building my gamer score for well over a decade now, and it is hard for me to get out of the microsoft gaming community because of that, but ps4 exclusive games blow microsoft out of the water here and are simply the sole reason why i had to get my hands on a ps4. yes, xbox has halo, but playstation has uncharted, god of war, horizon dawn zero, the last of us, and so so many more. if you are looking for a system with the best games, without a doubt playstation is the system for you!
there are a ton of great games for the system and with it is backlog of titles there is no shortage of entertainment on this console. i do not worry about 4k so the lack of that on this console does not bother me. the recent resident evil release sealed the deal for me.     as far as teh controllers go, i have the same gripe with the ps4 pro as with every other console. the lack of any rubber on the grip makes the controller feel lacking. this can easily be fixed with a cheap aftermarket add-on.     all in all this a great console and the upgraded graphics for the games that support it, are amazing.
i have always been a xbox fan, i own all of their consoles! recently i chose to buy a playstation 4 pro, and i am blown away. the 4k experience is amazing! the gameplay and graphics are smooth and fluent. there are alot of similarities between the playstation 4 and xbox one, when comparing graphics,speed and overall technology. i have not played playstation 4 online yet,so i ca not speak about that aspect. my overall opinion about the playstation 4 is 5 stars.. i give it the edge over xbox because of the game selection
the hdr label on the box wo not do it is justice until you experience it. make sure you have a 4k hdr compatible tv. the graphics, game-play, storyline, rendering, color spectrum, and resolution are enhanced for one of a kind gaming experience with the ps4 pro. some side notes: i upgraded the hard drive on the console to 2 tb firecuda sshd and so far has been running flawlessly. i also transfered all data (about 1 tb) from previous console and had no issues or data corruption. really loving the ps4 pro console so far.
i've been wanting to get a ps4 for several years, and finally broke down during sony is days of play sale during e3. the ps4 pro console delivered fully on my expectations, but be aware that although this is equipped for 4k gaming, it does not have a 4k blu-ray player for movies. bit of a silly choice on sony is part, but if you have a separate player for 4k flicks it is really not a big deal. i've been enjoying gaming on this system for a month now and have zero regrets.
this is a really nice upgrade to the 2nd year slim but there are a few caveats with my set-up... after the second year l got a 2tb ssd/hdd hard drive with my slim which really boosted gameplay in and of itself. i also purchased a 4k/hdr tv after ps4 pro purchase(moved 2tb hd to ps4 pro)  so with the ssd drive and the 4k tv it is awesome! but if you're tight on funds i would recommend a ssd hd and decent 4k otherwise if you can afford it go for it but wait for a sale!
what\s not to love! what can i say, through the years we\ve pretty much have had every console there is and the one that seems to get the most game play is our ever so loved playstation, so much so that we have had to purchase 3, one for the main living room, and 1 for each of the kids room, as crazy as it sounds but since this crazy game of fort night is a one player game the only way to keep the peace around here is if everyone got their own consoles to play on, so come birthdays or christmas the playstation was the gift of request!
in regards to whether it\s worth spending more vs a standard ps4, i really feel it will pay off. everything runs flawlessly on my 4k roku tv. 4k and pro enhanced games look amazing. such as battlefield looks stupid real. i have a vita so the playstation network is a great companion tool platform. exclusives are an added bonus and i do believe that if vr doesn\t consume the market in upcoming years, the 4k content in games coming out will make it well worth not only the visuals but the faster processor to handle the larger games.
i recently upgraded to this new model the cuh-7200 series because they were reviewed to be much quieter than the older models. if you've ever played intense games like uncharted 4 and spiderman you'll know that the system gets very loud, so much for me i could hear it over my tv speakers. not this model, it is super quiet though not as quiet as the xbox one models but not to far off either. the fact that i can hear my games now over the system is wonderful.     make sure before you buy a ps4 pro to get the cuh-7200 series.
havent had a ps since ps1, love this system easy to operate. couldnt tell you the difference in ps4 and ps4 pro, but the pro works and looks great. only issue ive experienced, as why a 4 and not a 5 star, may just be a sony thing but to charge having a plugged in controller (meanwhile cord didnt feel like it secured well in port) in standby mode (which says it will charge) so couldnt tell if it was charging. additionally, the cord felt too short and like i was too close to tv to play while charging. got a cradle charger to help.
my launch ps4 recently began showing signs of slow down. so, i went out and upgraded to ps4 pro. the unit is quicker with load times and just seems to move through menus seamlessly without hesitation. haven\t  noticed a big difference in graphical quality yet. but, that may just depend on the game. if your original unit still runs fine, there is no need to upgrade. but, if this is your first system, definitely go for the pro.
i'm not a gamer, but this machine is the smartest of "smart" tv is for any hd or 4k tv in your house. fast wifi connection over the dual-band router. best, ergonomic controller (way better feel than x-box,) gorgeous and superb game play in gta v, best, fastest netflix app layout with crystal clear hd and 4k and more. in life, a few extra dollars to get exactly what you want is a far better option than saving a fraction to settle for the lesser competition (the x-box equivalent.)
never been much of a gamer but thought i\d purchase one of these after playing around with my girlfriends. i work out in the aleutian islands for three months at a time and it get quite boring at night so i purchased this to play games and watch movies when i was off work for the night. it took a bit of getting used to the controls, but i\m really enjoying all this machine has to offer. i also get to communicate with my girlfriend more doing online games together when i\m gone.
i purchased this gaming console and after 3 days brought it back to the store for an exchange because i thought it had faulty wifi connection. it would just drop connection repeatedly. the new system did the same thing (with our router right next to it.) we ended up hardwiring to keep connection and now don\t have any issues. however, i don\t know that i would have upgraded from our regular ps4 had i read about all the connection issues beforehand.
sold my ps4 just before this console was announced because i was mostly an xbox gamer. then i switched to pc exclusively. i just bought the pro for the ps exclusives and it does not disappoint. the ui is still not great. i've always felt that way. something about it seems very unappealing and it lacks the user friendly appeal of xbox. the graphics are incredible though. definitely recommend getting this if you're considering a playstation but only if you have a 4k tv.
my ps4 pro console keeps crashing on me while doing normal browsing.. it crashed last night when trying to watch a trailer for a game i was looking to purchase. controller unresponsive, console unresponsive, i actually have to unplug the power cord!! and this has happened now 3x since i got it less than a month ago!!! best buy may have sold me a bad console.. prob some refurbished crap? love it when it works tho, hence the couple stars i gave this review.
we have owned an xbox one  for some time but finally decided to purchase the playstation for my 9 year olds b-day.  he wanted the show 19 and it is only on playstation.  the vr is amazing! i use it all the time to play golf, beat saber and other games... and i\m 48 :)  it\s a lot of money, but it is worth it and i bet you will spend more money going to trampoline parks and such.
i originally owned the first release edition ps4. which worked great for years but lately i noticed things were taking longer and the fan was awful. about a month ago i got the pro and it was amazing. it runs so much better than my old console. and while you'll need to own a 4k tv to truly experience the better graphics but even with my regular tv there was a definite improvement.
i bought this game system because of the spider-man game.  i have three xbox in the house and the children opposed this game system. i took a chance and purchased the game system and the kids love it. aside from playing spider-man the kids play just dance we have for the xbox but it\s nice to have additional game system in case the kids what to play separate and apart.
i bought it on january 22nd 2019. today is july 25th 2019. ps4 is already gone. i have probably around 70 hours of gameplay only since i barely play. i always turn it off properly and this thing is gone. blinking blue light and nothing to display. i have tryalread pressing the power button for about 7 seconds till 2nd beep amd it wont go to safe mode to reset it.
i have a 4k tv with hdr so i got a ps4 pro to take advantage of it. however, i do not think it is worth it. the pro is significantly larger and heavier than the slim, and the graphical upgrade is negligible. sure, some games offer a boost in fps, but it is inconsistent. and of course there is no 4k uhd bluray player. just standard bluray. stick with the slim unless you find a great deal on the pro. but even then, i prefer the sleekness of the ps4 slim.
was weary of upgrading my ps4 to this model at first but i'm so glad i did!  impeccable increase in quality, connection, and speed. the 4k makes games really immersive and goes great with my curved monitor. absolutely love this system, i'm excited to use it everytime. plus, the new controller it comes with is fantastic as well. everything about this system is a win!
my son really started to get into gaming so i picked ps4 pro up so we can take it to the next level.  games look great, everything works smooth and we're having a blast.  if you're on the fence... do not be.  go get it!  the ps5 is still over a year away and will play the same games because it takes a while for developers to create a good amount of games for new systems.
i finally bought myself a new console for my birthday, and even made the switch to playstation. the last console i had was a 360, so i was definitely due for an upgrade. the console is beautiful, everything works great. the extra space is wonderful and the graphics are sweet. it does not come with a stand as it is advertised with, but i do not mind. i really recommend spending the extra money for the pro, it is worth it.
all my son wanted for christmas was a ps4 pro....he said he prefers it over the latest x-box....according to him the graphics are way better,and he has this hooked up to his 4k tv....i ordered from bb because i knew i could trust them on truly having a brand new one(some reviews on amazon,says they received returned ones)....was highly impressed by bb lightning fast shipping and packing....unit arrived safe and in time for christmas giving....
in my opinion, if you have the 4k tv, it is worth going pro. especially on a newer tech tv, it has a noticable difference. they have updated the "community" options, and it makes it easier to interact (or even meet) people online.  i docked a star for 3 reasons. first, lack of backward comparability is pretty sucky. i have old games that i would like to see run on a more powerful machine (not that the graphics would upscale, but less load times, smoother running, etc.). second, i would have expected the "pro" to have an actual ssd, especially with how 3d nand has made higher capacities far more affordable. finally, i do not have the fastest internet (living in rural az), and it is frustrating to have an active load update for most games (requires the system on and does not allow playing in the background).   all and all, still worth the price, but not perfect. as an aside (because i heard rumors to the contrary), my ps4 pro plays my blu-ray dvds. i have not tested a wide set, but have some anime movies that run just fine.
i purchased the first ps4 console when it came out and i have had no problems. i bought the ps4 pro when it first came out and it lasted about 1.5 years but started over heating. even though i am now purchasing my 2 pro console i still love everything about the ps4 pro. i would switch to a xbox but it is hard not being able to be part of the playstation community where every one i know is on the ps4 console.
bought this today. the set up took some time and effort since all the typing i was doing using the game controller. not sure if there is a mobile app which can be used for keying in the stuff.  ui is good, and right now i am exploring some of the free games from playstation store. soon i will be buying paid games too. will give the review after few days.
i bought the pro because i wanted the best picture nonetheless. i paired it to asus gaming monitor and was amazed at the picture and smoothness of the games. coming from an xbox one x i was a bit let down due to sometimes being a bit laggy loading up certain things on the main menu. also the main menu is not as user friendly as compared to an xbox but does not take that long to learn.
i've been an xbox guy ever since the original came out. and, while i still love my xbox one x, there is something crisper about how the ps4 pro renders games and the exclusives are far more interesting. spiderman comes to life on the pro and god of war is absolutely stunning. i had purchased the original ps4 upon release, but the pro feels like a different console altogether. highly recommend it.
came in looking to upgrade to the pro, not knowing there were the 2 different versions. the hdr and the 4k. salesmen that helped me knew the difference and was able to break it down for me on which i needed. ended up with the 4k of course!! to go with my just recently purchased sony 4k tv!! (also bought here at my local bestbuy) overall great salesman that sold it to me and amazing product!!
we already owned a xbox with tons of figures and games so the thought of buying this was a hard pill to swallow. just buy it because i will tell you this is awesome. there are so many games exclusive to playstation and the pro model in 4k mode it comes alive! we added the vr headset and it\s as good as waiting in line 3 hours st disney to see avatar fir 2 minute ride but right in your home
i love video games and will play them until i get to old to play them. this console is way better than the original ps4. smoother processing and 4k streaming. please be aware that ps4 does not play 4k movies but it can stream them. the ps4 pro is a bit larger than the ps4 too but its solid and durable. $100 more for the ps4 pro vs. ps4 (regular). no brainer here. yes get it.
this console delivers on respect to graphics, smoothness and clarity for most games created after 2017. playing on a 4k fb is the icing on the cake because you can truly tell the difference in color and graphics. if you already own a ps4, however, the difference is not significant enough to upgrade just for the pro.
ive always been an xbox girl. love my gaming sessions; i grew up on lan parties. not saying i've converted but i'm very impressed with the ps4 pro. i play it just as much as my other console in my downtime since purchase. it is so enjoyable and extremely easy to figure out. also, my wireless xbox headphones are compatible with this system! score!
i've primarily used xboxes for the past 15+ years, but i felt a little adventurous and expanded my horizons by purchasing the ps4 pro. i love the system and feel like games purchased through playstation is store are better deals than i'd find on xbox. the system works perfect and has given me and the family many hours of entertainment.
this ps4 pro is so much faster than my launch ps4. it\s rated by the tech it has within to be 1/3 faster. loading is a breeze now for games as well as initially starting a game. i load in faster than my friends! more ram, faster processor, more storage and it makes all my games look so much better. hands down, this is the one to buy if you need an upgrade or for a first time buyer.
nick is an excellent staff member at 181 curtner avenue, san jose.  very helpful and courteous. however, call centre staff is not very effective and the waiting time is really long. call keeps getting transferred before issue is finally resolved. took me 1.5 hours just to link 2 merchant ids to 1 account. still one purchase is missing on it.
i was actually considering the oculus quest since i have the oculus go, however i'm very pleased with the ps4 pro along with the ps vr headset. i'm no professional gamer and i'm having quite the go at learning how to navigate and utilize these systems. large selection of games for every age and this consoles added features are a huge plus!
it\s the best gaming console you can buy hands down. there are so many options for games and then the added exclusives.   there are also plenty of other options for applications within the system.   some people say not having the ability to play 4k movies sucks but you really don\t want to use you console for anything other than gaming. but that\s just my opinion
we purchased the ps4 pro because of the storage and because of the hd compatibility. it is been great with the games and good quality for blu ray and dvd is. the only thing we do not like is whenever we turn the tv on or off the ps4 turns on and off as well. we figure it was because of the wifi but who knows.
i could not enjoy my standard ps4 any longer simply because the fan roared like a jet engine non-stop.  the ps4 pro makes no noise at all - even during really challenging combat.   the storage, performance and graphic upgrades are all winners - but peace and quiet to enjoy immersive gaming is a worth the cost alone.
i would 100% recommend ps4pro if you own a 4k tv or monitor but as far as if you dont own a 4k tv or monitor you wont be able to take full advantage of what the console can do, with that said you will still see a noticeable difference in loading speeds and even a slight difference in graphics not to mention the extra 1tb space doesnt hurt either!
hi, everyone, just wanna let you know,my grandson love this machine, best buy had it at a very reasonable price, and i always insure my purchases with the geeks, those guys are awsome.keep up good work, i always get my shopkick points when i am in the store, so drop buy check out the store, nice and clean. i love it.
i am extremely happy with my purchase, took me less than 5 minutes to find a sales associate and complete my transaction. i purchased this as a replacement for our old ps4. the old system sounded like a jet plane even after cleaning and kept overheating. now the new system looks even better on our 4k curved tv with no noise during gameplay.
bought this console for my husband and he claims it is awesome. it does not turn on automatically like the older ps4 used to do. the 1tb hard drive is a great amount of space for saving games. even our kids can save their games as well. my husband claims it is better when playing on an hd tv, and the quality of the video graphics is great. overall product is great!
i was pumped to finally get my ps4 and unleash the power of my 4k 60" sony bravia tv. i hooked up the ps4 pro only to find out that you cannot get youtube tv on it, which made my purchase 50% worthless. then, i found out that the vudu app wo not play 4k. i'm taking this back today and switching over to an xbox one x so that i can actually use the apps i need.
this is the second plantation 4 pro that i have purchased and have yet to have any issues with the system. the 1 terabyte memory helps with having up to 12 games on your system depending on how big the games data is. the 4k aspect is only for games so thats one thing to keep in mind, but on a 4k tv the games look amazing and well worth the buy.
i bought this for something to do when i spend long periods of time away from home for my job, and i\m blown away! not only are the games great, but i can shuffle through my netflix, and prime tv all from my hotels free wifi. so glad i bought this, it gets used every day almost if not for games for its other ps exclusive abilities.
definitely a nice and welcomed upgrade from the original ps$. the ps4 pro is great. and when paired with a sony x900e tv they are a amazing duo combined that is what i have mine hooked up too. higher resolution with 4k hdr support and plays your games at higher refresh rate. i highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a console to buy.
what can i say. i had the original model ps4 pro. it was loud, certain games would makes the fans seem like a jet is taking off. i haven\t encountered that with the same work load on the 7215b. it\s quieter, by far! performance seems faster but i also put in a 2tb sshd seagate hd as well. overall, i\m not mad at it! great console.
the ps4 pro is a great addition if you have a 4k tv, even if you already own a standard ps4. most recent games take advantage of the upscale in resolution. especially the first party titles, like spiderman and god of war which both look absolutely stunning. also there is a noticeable performance boost and games run smoother than ever before!
i decided to upgrade from the ps4 slim to this lovely beast.. the load times for games is around 300%-400% faster, and just basically all around its bigger, better, faster, and stronger than the standard ps4, kinda like the six million dollar man.. only waaaayyyyy cheaper and minus the cool sound effects when he jumps..
it has a fast load up menu on startup (comparing it to xbox one). i am more of an xbox user but after being on the ps4 for a couple months now i love both! the xbox one x defiantly has better 4k quality in my opinion than the ps4 pro but maybe i just don\t know how to set it up correctly.
it\s the pro of ps4 great news is it\s better than the pro. it\s resale value is more than an xbox so when it\s time to upgrade ur holding on to the investment more then xbox. user interface still responds as slow as ps4. it\s the only thing that xbox has ps4 beat on. besides that the ps exclusive games are amazing on this console
i bought this for my son who like all kids now is always playing online games. he was always complaining of the x-box lagging. so far he has enjoyed this much more. it is however to me a little more confusing to find the screen to be able to get into other aps like netflix. overall good product
i got this solely to play the ps exclusive mlb the show 19. i love baseball and that game is great so i love this. 4k and hdr is great. the xbox one x is more powerful and i think generally more impressive, but for exclusive games this is the best option. looking forward to spiderman and god of war.
console runs quiet compare to past models, controller feels cheaply made when comparing it to competitors, selling point of the ps4 pro was the exclusives which i found bland. i was highly disappointed to find it  does not play games in true 4k and does not have a true 4k blu-ray player.
i recently upgraded, finally, to a 4k tv. i purchased the ps4 pro hesitantly thinking it wouldn\t make that much of a difference but i was very wrong. the clarity is just perfection. any game you play it\s like your really there. my wife thought it was a real baseball game i watching when i played mlb the show. love it, worth it
i had a ps4 1st gen with the touch eject issue, changed to a xbox one s and decided to come back. this console is not much bigger than my xbox was, and the heating and noise comments are trus, but exactly the same as the xbox. i do not regret at all! just waiting my 4k hdr tv to check all its power!
i'd been scoping out the ps4 for a while, having been a longtime nintendo person. but with the exclusive titles on ps4, it was time. after doing the research, i decided the pro model was the way to go. it plays amazing, looks amazing on my tv, and it is been hard to put the controller down!
i've had a ps3 in the past and struggled to get used to the controller over the keyboard that i'd used for years. enter the ps4 along with the vr controls and the game play takes on a whole new experience. the system is fast and offers a lot of features that i will probably never use. that being said, the one thing i could do in my ps3 was play a bluray and the ps4 does not ship with that ability. you have to purchase (free) app to play media on the ps4. i gave up making that work after 10 minutes and moved back to just a normal bluray player.    also, another thing to note is that the unit prefers to go into "rest" mode when you power off, but that is not off. if you have power issues where you are, i recommend you power it off with that option instead of rest so you do not get the issues with it doing checks when it powers back on.    neither of the issues that i experience were enough to remove a star and i would recommend to someone else.
i bought this because my original busted and wouldn\t work (turns out it was an easy fix) and i couldn\t be happier. i don\t have a 4k tv yet but i\ve already noticed a small difference in some games. definitely worth it. especially if you\re like me and won\t buy the next gen console for quite some time.
video quality and graphics are astounding.  my only complain and this is something that i noticed not too long ago was the noise that this machine made.  it was really loud, hopefully they come up with an update that helps with this issue that only happened once or at least that was noticeable
i was on the fence about upgrading my original ps4 since the ps5 is probably only a year or two away, but this is a major improvement. even on 1080 the graphics are better, gameplay and menus are soo much smoother, and this thing does not sound like it is going to explode like my og ps4 either.
i love the playstation 4 pro.i am playing red dead redemption.this has got to be the best game ever created.the graphics are life like.i like how easy the playstation turns on and off. employees of best buy are the greatest.always helpful. ca not wait for the next red dead game to come out.
ordered the ps4 pro after donating my old ps4 to a friends child, and it came to front door in 2 days, big box and full of de big bags so it won\t get any damage and un rapping that box was like christmas! connected everything and the 4k was awesome! playing cod is much better now! the speed everything!
i can\t say the ps4 pro is perfect as it isn\t a 4k blu-ray player despite having the capability. sony actually had to disable the ability. -_- ps4 pro is still the best console with the best game lineup. i have an xbox one s \i know the x is equal to the pro\ & the ps4 pro is better in almost every way.
this is a great system for this generation. this is actually a lateral move. i had the original ps4, but since i have a 4k tv now, i updated my game system & it looks so different. definitely a great product. also you may want to upgrade the internal hard drive to a 2tb, because the enhanced games take up more space.
turned in my old computer for a ps4 pro and it\s a great system with a lot to offer. the quality is amazing. but for some reason sometimes the frame rate drops and the system freezes for a little during games or when i press the ps button on the controller during a game to get to the home menu. overall it was worth it.
my old ps3 died so i bought the ps4 pro with 4k support and wow, what a difference compare to 1080p, there is no going back. the ps4 pro might get a little hot near the back but so far it is not causing any problems. the only complain i have is the eject and power button is tiny and hard to see.
great to go with my 4k tv, noticeably better graphics than my standard launch model, and very comparable to graphics on the xbox one x. only get this if you have a 4k tv and extra money to spare, if not get a 4k tv first, they are super cheap nowadays, and wait for ps5.
how can you go wrong. runs smooth. i replaced the thermal paste with thermal grizzly kryonaut and replaced the thermal pads from thermal grizzly because sony cheaped out and made them smaller than the chips. so now it runs super quiet even on heavy games like god of war!     sorry to the people with louad ps4 is
i decided to purchase a ps4 pro after buying a 4k tv & i have to admit it doesn\t disappoint. i would only recommend if you have a 4k tv or are planning on buying on in the future. it\s a amazing product. god of war is a great game to test the graphics out on it.
when i first plugged in my ps4 it greeted me with an error that stated nw-35959-1, it did not let me connect to my 5g network. i do not believe that this was best buy is error. sony did eventually fix it with a system update, and the console works smoothly from then onward.
i originally bought this to add to my home theater as a 4k player and gaming. i was disappointed to find out after i bought this, that despite the fact it plays games in 4k, it does not support 4k movie playback. i would not recommend this as a 4k gaming system either... just build a pc, its more versatile.
i tried the xbox one prior to getting the ps4 pro since it was cheaper, but i just could not do it - i like the ps systems. the controller is slightly bigger than the ps3, but ergonomically i think that is great and it is not much of a difference. the menu is also much easier to navigate compared to the xbox systems.
i highly suggest spending the extra money to get the pro model. the graphics on the games are unreal. i'm excited to start playing other games and watching movies on it. i'm not even sure that my tv is 4k but the game plan is this system will last us and we will eventually upgrade to a 4k tv for the full effect.
ps4 pro is a total entertainment machine! i bought this product as a special request by my son and grandson as a gift (since they have same date of birthdays). they said they enjoy playing games and watching 4k movies with this system. it was definitely well worth buying this ps4 pro
i purchased this on a whim and i\ve throughly enjoyed using it. it\s packed with a lot of features but still baffled as to why sony removed the bluray capabilities like their older ps4 consoles. that said, i\m happy with the product and i haven\t even explored all of it capabilities as of yet. solid product!
the product seems to be much more particular about maintaining wi fi connection during online gaming. i never had an issue with my standard ps4, but have had significant drop rates with the pro model. also, the store did not have the bundle it advertised, so did not receive a game with the console as expected.
i recently upgraded to 4k uhd and my ps4 came next. not really sure if it\s worth the money i paid to get a picture that is just slightly better. not living up to the hype for me. but the console it\s self feels like it runs faster and smoother than the release day one i\ve had for all the previous years.
i was already a fan of the ps4 pro when it was first released, but i like how sony finally addressed the noisy fan with the latest model (cuh-7202b). while it does run a bit hotter, i love that i can finally enjoy my games without the system sounding like a jet preparing for take off.
in my opinion ps4 blows xbox out of the water. i used to love the 360 but ps4 has way more exclusives the xbox exclusives are garbage. dont waste your money on an xbox 1 x especially, its over priced and for what you pay theres no games out that even take advantage of its hardware.
i just recently updated my console from the old ps3 and love it. i went for the ps4 pro with one tb of space. heck, it was only a ben franklin more than the base model. get it, you won\t be disappointed. it has a sleep mode so you can fire it right back up when you get up.
the ps4 pro is a great system to have if you are looking for a large library of games, want to take full advantage of psvr, and want to maximize your games on a 4k tv. the latest model is much quieter than launch model pro systems (i had one).
really great product especially to throw at your wife and kids when they\re upsetting you, i can\t recall how many times i came home from work and my annoying a** family comes to my mancave to great me and i just unplug it and chunk it at them, great buy
even though this console generation is coming to an end soon, the ps4 pro is definitely still worth buying. on the merits of games and games alone, the ps4 is this generations clear winner. sony simply blows microsoft out of the water when it comes to 1st party exclusive games.
i was looking for a console to play video games for streaming and honestly the ps4 pro is amazing! it allows you to broadcast with the click of a button. and if you have a 4k tv the graphics are amazing! i use to mainly play on xbox but since i\ve gotten this i haven\t even reached for my xbox.
we decided to get a new playstation because we were looking for a gaming system that offered the best of everything. the ps4 pro, does this. from playing games in crystal clear format to watching the latest movies on the 4k option which makes them so lifelike. this was so worth the purchase!
my teenage wanted it to play fortnite with his friends on ps4 instead of his xbox. the ps4 pro, i must admit is worth the extra $100. the graphics are pretty amazing and as a mom, i do not know much about gaming, but the graphics are "wow" and the other differences are subtle, but noticeable.
picked this one for the 2nd time due to getting another newer 4k hdr tv for my basement. i love the playstation brand and have for 25 years. they have the best exclusive games for their system. only wish the pro systems played 4k movies like the xbox one s/x.
finally got a ps4 pro, i was looking for a bundle with a game but couldnt find any. but joining the playstation store gives u great discounts on games and movies, takes a while (and memory) to download them, but i'm sure i wont get anywhere near the 1 tb of memory on this thing.
i have loved playstation my entire life, growing up on the classic ps2 console i couldn\t wait for the day i saved enough to buy the ps4 pro! it\s amazing, with the 4k quality, plenty of storage, downloadable apps. and i love being able to watch my blu-ray dvd\s on it as well!
previously owned the classic ps4 which i purchased on release. over the years, with the evolution of ps4 games, i began to see dropped frames, and high amounts of lag. in the more recent games like god of war, the game was almost unplayable. fast forward, i picked up a c8 oled and the ps4 pro. it is far and away a better console than the original in game. there is still some lag, but overall a much better experience as i am now in 4k vs 1080. my only real gripe is how slow and laggy the basic menu is, especially with any program running in background. pause netflix to play a game... instant regret. exit game to join voice chat, better have a minute to spare. overall a huge step up from the original but not perfect. biggest disappointment is the lack of 4k blu ray support, however i knew of this going in, and did not dock a star.
the best way to entertain a stressful adult  i bought this play station as a gift for my adult daughter as an outlet for the stress from her career. it is easy to set-up. one can use it to watch hulu, netflix and youtube and get messages about new releases. the controller is a comfortable fit making it easy to play the games. however, it seemed a lengthy process in selecting the games. when i saw the violent ones i was shocked. if you did not want to blow everyone away before you picked up the controller, you may want to after playing some of these games. thank goodness for pac man! i thought the subscription was pricey at first and then i saw how much the games cost and thought, "if you are into gaming, i guess it is better to subscribe than buy." since it comes with only one control i could not join in the "fun". perhaps on my next visit, while she is at the office, i can try it.
i already had a nintendo switch, but with also having a 4k tv, i felt like i was missing out on some of the better games out there with 4k graphics- maybe even some of the best games ever made. between the xbox one x and ps4 pro, i went with the ps4 pro (almost one month ago) because of the games. i always thought it was a bit of hyperbole to say that someone would buy a system just for one game. but after experiencing spider-man, god of war, horizon zero dawn, the last of us, uncharted 4, and the mlb the show series, i get it. swinging around as spider-man in manhattan at sunset, in 4k hdr, is just pure fun. backwards capability being confirmed for the ps5 was another big factor in purchasing the ps4 pro later in its life. highly recommended! i would make the same decision again and again!
i have not owned a playstation since the ps2. never even played the ps3. this is my first one in forever. i have an xbox one classic, and the playstation 4 pro just destroys it. i am a avid pc gamer, and this was something i wanted to try, and i am very pleased with my purchase.
this is for my husband to replace his other playstation. i don\t play it but i was pleased to know that this does not get overheated like the other one and it does not sound super loud like the other one. it\s sleek and slim and everyone seems to enjoy it.
my wife has a regular ps4 and one of the biggest things that i realized after a few days of use is how much quieter the pro is. i very much enjoy the extra storage space for games as well as the sleek design. overall very pleased with my purchase and will recommend to others.
i wanted to replace my older model ps4 with the pro for my 4k tv. this console did not disappoint at all. there are noticeable differences in textures between the 2 consoles in games like dragon quest 11. the loading time is improved and the extra storage is a god send.
playstation 4 pro was bought for my husband as one of his gifts. his eyes lit up when he opened the box just like a little kid. he loves the graphics. he loves all games i purchased for the game. he loves to play his virtual reality games on it. everything seems so real.
ps4 pro is beast and it is excellent device for gaming. performance of ps4 is too good and works with all type of games. so many games are available in market for ps4. graphics and everything runs very smoothly. it works very well with ps vr bundle with amazing gaming experience.
friend of mine got the pro and said it was worth the upgrade. i noticed he loaded faster after he got his. i went and got my own. as soon as i turned on spiderman i knew it was worth it. 4k definitely shines through. loading in online games was noticable.
i have xbox is, and a switch, but this is my first ps4... i bought it for the vr capabilities, and they really are state of the art. everything is smooth, and the system runs perfectly. this may be the best video game console i have ever owned. and the vr, is a must! wow!!!
i finally got tired of every time i start my xbox one, i have a 100 gb update or more and takes 8 hrs to complete, so i dont get to play. bought this and have loved it (since i can come home and play, any updates now have been small in comparison)
the reason for the upgrade primarily was for the 4k capabilities of the pro, and it\s been terrific so far. paired with a 4k tv this is excellent. the slight upgrades in speed and memory are great too, don\t get me wrong but the 4k hdr is where it\s at now.
this ps4 pro was very easy to hook up by the way just hooked up my 4k cable to the input of my tv and then plugged in the power supply and turned it on and set it up took me less then 5 min to hook it up. i\m playing gta 5 on my 4k tv and the pic is crystal clear
i am an xbox fan have been forever bought this so the family could play vr. also to play the playstation only games as well. the reason for 4 stars is that it does not have a 4k dvd player. the amount of money i had to pay this should have one.
all i can say is there is a huge difference. between a ps4 and ps4 pro .... huge !!! graphics, game play! processor speed alone and hard drive space helps !! must buy ! don\t spend your money on a ps4 unless it\s the ps4 pro !!! you will thank me later!
the best playstation i have ever used i used to play on every new ps but this one is phenomenal with the 4k and a lot of storage but my only issue its kinda loud when you download games or play for couple hours but other than that . thank you sony :)
i bought this ps4 pro on sale and i'm happy with it. so far, no problems. i used to own a limited edition ps4 slim but i gave it to my little brother as a gift. i noticed games run a bit smoother on the pro compared to the slim which is nice. overall satisfied.
after trying xbox one x and ps4 pro, i can say that the ps4 has a more premium feel to it in regards to gaming. those looking for a media box, this will do great if no 4k tv is at home. i would not buy if you already have the original ps4 or slim version.
my son gave me his old ps4 to help keep my mind busy because i'm physically limited. after i got got hooked on call of duty black opps 4, i knew i needed to buy the new ps4 pro. all i can say is wow. i'm now hooked on the new and improved gamer.
at first i was not sure to upgrade to the pro, but after playing all sorts of games on it. no comparison, very happy with the quality of graphics and sound. it is bigger than the regular console, but it is ok. highly recommend to the avid players out there.
the last time i played was the ps2 era, they\ve added a lot of complexity and depth to gameplay but i find the controller to be severely lacking. took me way too long to get aim down on fps games. driving dynamics are good in the driving games i\ve played.
favorite gaming console i've ever played or owned. the apps for video streaming have awesome, full-featured interfaces, and often allow for more audio options (2.1 vs. 5.1 surround) than the desktop webapps or other consoles.  i do not have a 4k tv, so i ca not speak to the enhanced features, but the extra usb3 connection on the back for an external hard-drive is very much appreciated, and the power / eject buttons are in a better location, on a matte (instead of glossy) button, so it is slightly easier to read the insanely tiny icons to figure out which is which.  it is the console, it plays the games, what more is there to say? we're all really just waiting for "death stranding", and that is all that matters, right??
it took a while for me to figure out whether i wanted to splurge for the ps4 pro, and the only thing i regret is not doing it sooner. i'm going back and testing out all my old games. this thing is powerful and runs super quiet. it provides 4k and enhanced graphics, and some games even give you graphics options! for older games, the performance boost improves load times and framerates. i thought it was going to roar with noise but i've yet to hear the fan spin up at all, it idles even at 4k in my claustrophobic media shelf. the only noise you'll notice is the cd spinning when first downloading data from the disk. i noticed the "near" 4k and all of the graphics enhancements right away, and i was afraid i would not. now, when i see the old resolution and graphics it almost looks like standard def! it is worth it.
yes, it does not play 4k disks. it does not make sense, sony invented blue ray and the first to offer 1080p disk player and they failed miserably with latest version the ps4. i took it back got the xbox, it has a 4k player and it has better game servers.
really nice upgrade from ps3, except for surround sound output and no solid state drive (ssd) option.  the ps3 supported 7.1 audio through the hdmi port.  for the ps4, you can only get 2.0 stereo over hdmi.  you need to use the optical audio out toslink port on the ps4 to get anything above that.  you also need to set the audio output option in the movie player application to use anything above 2.0 stereo, which is the default setting instead of something that supports 5.1, 7.x or 9.x surround sound.  it was baffling to me why a game played natively in 7.1 surround sound while a blu-ray disc only played in 2.0 stereo until i found the setting.
i've been wanting to get a second console and between the switch and ps4 pro, it will be the sales that get me.  e3 sale was good timing but nintendo did not budge so i went with the pro.  i also have an xbox x so i have been comparing simple 4k streaming and honestly the performance fabd visuals from the x is much better. not a little but much.  i really want to get a same game to compare now like red dead 2 or anthem to do gaming performance but as of right now, it is the x.  it does not change the fact i am happy my kids get to play other exclusives now, they are tearing up god of war and spiderman. the controller is pretty nice the lights and speaker is a cool addition.
i upgraded after trying out a ps4 slim for 3-4 months. i wanted a better game play experience and to take advantage of the 4k uhd features. we've used xbox 360 in our home in the past and decided to give ps a chance since it allows offline game play for downloaded games, something i read was not completely possible with xbox one initially. i am happy with the purchase. switching my profiles and game data from the slim to the pro was easy as well. i kept checking the settings on both manually to make sure everything transferred correctly.  i could not believe how fast and accurate the transfer was because doing so with pcs\laptops takes days.
i was very happy with my 1tb gold ps4 slim, but it only output 1080p. i recently purchased a new 4k tv, and decided to upgrade my ps4 too now that some of the games coming out support 4k output. and wow. what a difference. it is subtle, but it looks gorgeous. i could swing around the city all day as spider-man, or ride around new hanover as arthur morgan, just admiring how beautiful everything looks. i ca not wait to see what the next games look like, and even better yet, look forward to a ps5! unfortunately, the ps4 pro does not play 4k ultra hd discs, but it does support blu-ray. not a show stopper for me, but would've been nice to have that little extra built in. nevertheless, i am extremely happy with this purchase. yee haw y'all!
i bought the ps4 pro in may 2018, and a year later, it still runs as well as can be expected from a playstation or sony product. i've had no issues at all with the product. however, i hope the new iteration sony has planned will do something about cooling and ventilation. it is not as loud as the ps3, but its noise is still equivalent to having a small fan running. and it definitely heats up a small room such as an office or bedroom. after a long session of playing, three or four hours, the room is way too warm to sleep comfortably. hopefully, this is improved in the next generation. otherwise, it is such a great product with plenty to offer both gamers and nongamers.
i have been a die-hard pc person for a long time, but finally broke down and bought a console. of course the specs of my pc blow the ps4 away, but then again my video card alone cost more than this thing. overall, i like it. i've played it on 4k and 1080 tvs and it looks good on both. i do not like how it has to be connected to the internet for anything to function (even the dvd player??), but i guess that is just how things work nowadays. i bought it during the sony sale for $350 and i think it was worth it. i'm not sure if it will pull me away from pcs, but i am no longer skeptical of consoles-or at least this one.
this system is quite powerful. load times are much faster compared to original ps4. make sure you do have a tv that is compatible with 4k/hdcp/hdr for full effect. also note that the hdr feature is not a system based feature, the game itself dictates whether or not the system will broadcast 4k. the only complaint is that if i switch between hdmi ports while the ps4 pro is still on, then go back to the ps4 pro i experience a static screen. from the research i have done this is due to hdcp broadcasting through the hdmi. make sure to use the supplied hdmi cable. note this does not occurs while playing the pro. only if inputs are switched. overall this is a great console
after owning the original ps4, the pro has slight upgrades to the original ps4. the visuals are a bit better and the load times are faster, but there are not too many games that utilize the system to its full potential. that could be a bit disappointing for some people. also the hdmi cable that was included with the system was more on the cheaper end of hdmi cables. i would recommend buy a better hdmi cable. overall, my best advice is if you have a 4k tv and feel the need to update your entertainment center, then the pro is the latest in video game entertainment. there just is not enough special features that would justify buying the system if you don\t own a 4k tv.
this console is excellent. i already had a ps4 slim and loved it. the ps4 pro adds 4k streaming functionality so i bought it for the living room big screen. there are more providers of 4k streams coming out all the time and i wanted a good 4k streamer as well as a game console for the living room - this unit does both flawlessly. an added plus - by having the slim and the pro in the house my wife and i added the ps vrs to the consoles and now play multiplayer games (vr games too) against each other on our home network. the pro is more expensive than the slim, but easily worth the price is you are looking for a unit that plays blu-ray disks, games, and streams 4k content over the internet.
the last gaming system i had was an xbox 360 and i love it. then the xbox one comes out and it is nothing but a nightmare to me so when i finally after all these years was able to get my pro i can tell anyone that you wo not be disappointed to have gotten this system. it is the best thing that i bought and never had any issues with it. the only thing i will complain about is if you have a power outage or you accidentally shut something off it can damage the system if the pro is on so you have to be very careful with that and that always has me on guard. otherwise i highly recommend buying this.
bought it for 4k capabilities and migrated from a ps4.    setup and migration sw was fantastic. seamless. brought all my games and history from the ps4 flawlessly.    have recurring problems on power up with denon avrx6400h/lg c8 tv recognizing hdmi signal. tv recognizes dolby vision but either black screen or picture with serious flicker. need to power cycle receiver sometimes to get it to work.    the upscaling on the ps4 was so good that the improvement to 4k dolby vision is not that noticeable.    some improvement on assassins creed frame stutter but it still exists.    seems to have more crashes on hitman.    a bit quieter than the ps4 but disk is still noisy.
very happy overall with it. lots of power for gaming, and its selection of media apps (such as hulu, netflix, etc.) along with it is ability to play regular blu ray dvds makes it a fantastic all around entertainment machine. my only gripe is not with the console itself, but rather with my concerns about privacy on the playstation network. after reading around about their security issues, i would not recommend putting your credit card number on there, but rather, just using store bought playstation gift cards. and other than that, happy gaming!
i have gone through a number of sony and and nintendo console through the years and the ps4 is easily my favorite for one simple reason. in just two years from purchasing this console, there has been more than twice as many games, largely comprised of exclusive titles, in my library for this console than any other i have owned. games like god of war, spider-man, horizon: zero dawn, nier: automata, gravity rush, uncharted 4, shadow of the colossus, and many more has given me more game time and use out of this console than any other i have owned. ps4 might go down as one of the most prolific consoles in terms of quality exclusive content in generations.
i upgraded from the 1st gen base model. absolutely a huge difference. right off i noticed a big difference in load up times, the overall smoothness of transitioning from one screen to the next and through the menus. i love to play call of duty and even in the black ops 4 blackout mode, there was a big difference in the speed and quality of how the graphics were rendered and displayed even without a 4k tv.  for me, it was an upgrade that was well worth it and i would recommend the ps4 pro model to anyone who loves to game and wants the best system on the market!
